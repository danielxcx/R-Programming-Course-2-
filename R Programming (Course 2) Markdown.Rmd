## Week 1

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here I am making a function.

```{r}
myfunction <- function(x) {
  y <- rnorm(100)
  mean(y)
}
myfunction(x)
myfunction(x)
```

Here is a second function. I currently have a Markdown file open, and I am writing the scripts in a different file.

```{r}
second <- function(x) {
  x + rnorm(length(x))
}

second(10)
second(76)
```
